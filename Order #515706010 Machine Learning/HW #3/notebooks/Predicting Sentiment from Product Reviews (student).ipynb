    "* Do some feature engineering\n",
    "* Train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews.\n",
    "* Inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model.\n",
    "* Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review.\n",
    "* Given the logistic regression weights, predictors and ground truth labels, write a function to compute the **accuracy** of the model.\n",
    "* Inspect the coefficients of the logistic regression model and interpret their meanings.\n",

The difficulty arises as the sentiment model puts too much weight on extremely rare words. A way to rectify this is to apply regularization, to be covered in Module 4.

       "\"While I've purchased items from Amazon for years, I rarely write reviews. I felt compelled to write one because, although there are only a few reviews at this point, I have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews. I'm hoping as more people purchase these, the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself. I'll address the three biggest complaints I've read from others:Sound Quality: I think these headphones sound great. I've never owned an expensive pair so I'm not able to compare them to higher-end offerings, but I've owned dozens of cheap and mid-range headphones in the 15-50 range. I'm not an audiophile or a musician so if I'm missing something that should be coming through, but isn't, I'm fine with my ignorance. I would say they're slightly better than Apple's buds (which I liked very much and used for years, most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year). There's no tinny, listening through a can sound that's all-too-common with headphones in this price range. As far as people saying they don't compare to Apple's buds, well I don't know, maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of Apple's buds that are amazing. But compared to the regular earpods, I think Amazon's headphones actually sound a bit better. They provide a nice, full sound and represent highs, lows and mids equally well (mainly listening to metal).Fit and Feel: Some people have complained about these falling, or feeling like they're going to fall, out of their ears. There's some validity to this, although obviously it depends on your specific ears. I don't feel like they're going to fall out at all, but if I give the cord a tug, they don't stay as secure as my Apple buds.Read more\""
